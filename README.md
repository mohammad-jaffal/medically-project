Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database.
- For the video call system, the app uses the [agora_uikit](https://pub.dev/packages/agora_uikit) package.
- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
